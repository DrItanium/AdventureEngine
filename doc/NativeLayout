If you've looked at the native folder then you may be very confused in how it
is laid out. Well never fear, this document will explain the layout of the
native folder.

Originally, I did not break the CLIPS source code apart from the code I added
for the adventure engine. Not only did this make it difficult to maintain but
also just didn't look very clean. I originally fixed this by having folders for
my add on code. However, this still made it a pain to add new code. I modified
it a third time to put the CLIPS source code in the Core folder and my
additions in the System folder. It may change again but the changes will be
more of how the makefiles work as opposed to a layout change. 

Anyway, there are two folders

Core/
System/

These folders take their names from how the unreal engine does things. 

The Core library contains the CLIPS source code which handles the majority of
the cross platform work. The rest of it will be handled through backend
definitions. 

The System library defines the set of functions that are exposed into the
adventure engine for use in writing games. These are a standard set of
operations that make the game cross platform without having to rewrite the game
itself.
