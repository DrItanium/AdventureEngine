This branch of the adventure engine is specifically for the virtual machine
that powers the game Another World. I have licensed all code specific to this
branch under the GPLv2 since I am implementing the VM based off of the C++ code
found at https://github.com/fabiensanglard/Another-World-Bytecode-Interpreter


<<<<<<< HEAD
This is a test of the adventure engine to see how plausible (and efficient) it
is to implement a virtual machine as an expert system.

Folder layout:
native/ - contains all of the C code (including CLIPS)
tools/ - contains tools used by the adventure engine in one way or another
lib/ - contains all the functions, templates, and classes used by the adventure engine
logic/ - contains all the rules for the different modules that make up the adventure engine
init/ - contains a special module that contains all of the functions that
increase maintainability of code over using raw CLIPS. This is always loaded
first
