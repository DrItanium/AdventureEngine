This branch of the adventure engine is specifically for the virtual machine
that powers the game Another World. I have licensed all code specific to this
branch under the GPLv2 since I am implementing the VM based off of the C++ code
found at https://github.com/fabiensanglard/Another-World-Bytecode-Interpreter


This is a test of the adventure engine to see how plausible (and efficient) it
is to implement a virtual machine as an expert system.
