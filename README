The adventure engine is a back end system for handling adventure games. As with
most of my modern works the code uses an expert system to do the dirty work.
This is because the expert system makes different aspects of the adventure game
easy to do. 

This includes inventory management, combination, and character interaction. All
of the information used to keep track of this information can be easily kept
track of through the use of facts and instances within the expert system. The
only part that has to be handled outside the expert system is things such as
input handling, sound playing, and drawing to the screen. 

Inside of the src folder there are two folders (adventure and clips), adventure
is the expert system code and clips contains all of the code for CLIPS.
