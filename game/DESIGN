The design of the expert system implementation of Colossal Cave Adventure has
to be broken down into several parts

1) Taking user input
2) Performing actions based on user input
3) Informing the user of the result 
4) Storing the world (backend)

Taking user input is easy because one of the features of CLIPS (and expert
systems in general) is that they are conversational. This makes taking in user
input and informing the user a very simple task. Even the act of performing 
actions based on user input is pretty easy.

The harder part is the storing and encoding of the world. There are several
aspects to this

1) Converting the original information found in adven.dat into a knowledge
representation
2) Handling custom game events
3) saving and loading games. 


Of the above items the easiest is saving and loading games. This can be
acomplished quite easily through the use of objects. The only problem is that
my savegame format will be saving all of the instances to a plain text file.
This will allow cheating to occur.
