The Instruction Set Architecture CLIPS is a modified version of CLIPS that
contains new functions meant to make it possible to simulate instruction set
architectures. The version forked is 6.30 (CLIPSJNI 0.3).

These new functions are bitwise operators right now but may include more at a
later time.
